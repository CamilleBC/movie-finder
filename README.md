Small test with Ionic 4

The live project can be found at [movie-finder.camillebc.me](https://movie-finder.camillebc.me/).

You can use `ionic serve` at the root of the repository to start a local server.

## What is it?

A simple search using RxJS, Ionic and Angular components/services.

The goal was simply to learn how to use those libraries.
The initial fetch is a bit long, as it populates an internal array before using observables and a reactive [FormControl](https://angular.io/api/forms/FormControl) to search and filter the initial results.
